# üìò Key Ansible Concepts

A short reference to the **core ideas** behind Ansible ‚Äî and a few you‚Äôll meet once you‚Äôre comfortable with the basics.

Use this as a quick refresher when returning to the project.

## üß© Core (Mandatory) Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Inventory** | Lists the hosts or groups of hosts that Ansible manages, and how to connect to them. |
| **Playbook** | A YAML file that defines what Ansible should do on those hosts. |
| **Task** | A single action within a playbook (e.g. create a file, install a package). |
| **Module** | The actual building block that performs work ‚Äî each task calls a module (e.g. `ping`, `copy`). |
| **Node (Host)** | A system managed by Ansible ‚Äî in this sandbox, the Docker containers (`node1`, `node2`). |

üí° *If you understand these five concepts, you can already run and modify most playbooks.*

## üå± Introduced Later (Nice to Know)

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Role** | A reusable structure that groups related tasks, files, and variables for modular automation. |
| **Variable** | Values that make your playbooks flexible (e.g. paths, usernames, messages). |
| **Template** | A text file with Jinja2 placeholders that render dynamically using variables. |
| **Vault** | Encrypts sensitive data like passwords or API keys within your repo. |

üí° *These are worth revisiting once you‚Äôve customised your first playbook successfully.*

## üß† Quick mental model

Core flow:
Inventory ‚Üí Playbook ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Nodes

When projects grow:
‚Üë Add Roles, Variables, Templates, Vaults

> **Think of it as:**

> *Inventory = where* ‚Ä¢ *Playbooks = what* ‚Ä¢ *Roles = how* ‚Ä¢ *Variables/Templates = flexibility*
